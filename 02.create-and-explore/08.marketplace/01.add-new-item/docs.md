## Overview

Learn how you can upload your items to the Marketplace and be made available to all users in High Fidelity. 



## Introduction

If you've created a 3D Model or written a script for a model of a dog to follow your avatar, you can make it available for other users to download.

Let's go through the process of uploading an item to Marketplace!

We're going to upload a model of a water fountain. This process covers three major steps:

- Starting the process of adding the item in Marketplace. 
- Using Interface to get the .JSON file.
- Uploading to Marketplace. 



### Adding an Item to Marketplace

- Go to High Fidelity's [Marketplace](https://highfidelity.com/marketplace) on the web. 
- Log in with your credentials if you haven't. 
- The page displays different items available in Marketplace and the various categories they fall under. ![](scr1.PNG)
